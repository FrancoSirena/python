# Python
This is a loosely typed language, so the type of our variables is defined by their values. We have several primitives in Python:
- String, Number, List, Date, Dict: Just like any other language.
- Sets: It's has an array like structure that keeps just the unique values, Sets is not sortable and keep its variable on the way they were included. Advantages here is that Sets use hashes to index their values so it is much faster to access values inside of it.
- Tuples: Tuples are much like arrays but they are not sortable and they are immutable. It is really easy to destructure it and to make readability improve in our APP. Because they are immutable they use much less memory than lists
- Classes: The class Model in Python looks much like Prototype Inheritance in Javascript.

## Class
  Declare:
    `class ``Name``:`
  Constructor:
    `def __init__(self)`
  Interfaces/Inheritance:
    `class ``Name``(``Parent``)`
